**Minecraft Coordinate Storage System**

A web application that can record your Minecraft coordinates with ease!

This project was completed by Anton Chuchuva as part of a school project which solves the issue of recording Minecraft coordinates. With this system, coordinates are stored in worlds and contain lots of useful information, including the structure type, what the coordinate contains and additional notes. All coordinates are stored independently on a secure database and web hosted using Dreamhost. You can even view all your coordinates on a relative map and filter them according to different realms.

To use this program, no additional installation is required! Simply visit the website:

and get started by signing to create your own, unique destinations!

After you have signed in, you can try to add new worlds giving them a name and then clicking on the image to open them. Adding destinations is a breeze and all coordinates can be seen on a list! If you have another friend wanting to see your worlds, enable the share worlds in the map sidebar and give them the world's ID.

Special thanks to David Hollingworth for providing an excellent course and helping me understand APIs in PHP and to Pavel Chuchuva who frequently gave me a hand when I was coding my frontend and backend services.
